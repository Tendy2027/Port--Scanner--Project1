Project: TCP Port Scanner (Syntecxhub Cybersecurity Internship - Week 1)
Author: Tendani Shonisani Thomu

Description: Built a multi-threaded TCP port scanner in Python to check open/closed/timed-out ports on a host. Uses socket programming for connections, threading for concurrency, argparse for host/range options, logging for results, and exception handling.

How to Run:
python port_scanner.py 127.0.0.1 --start 1 --end 100

Features Met:
- TCP scanning with sockets
- Concurrency via threads
- Single host or port range
- Prints/logs open/closed/timeouts
- Handles exceptions (timeouts, errors)

Learned: Socket basics, threading, error handling, logging.
